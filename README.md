SQL Project : Student-College Enquiry Database

Designed and implemented a student-college enquiry database. The database schema encompassed tables, views, sequences, synonyms and indexes to optimize data access and management. Utilized DML statements for data population. Employed SQL queries incorporating WHERE, HAVING, GROUP BY, ORDER BY and row limiting clauses to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data. Additionally, I leveraged advanced concepts like CASE expressions, single row and group functions, joins, subqueries, set operators, CTEs and window functions to achieve complex data transformations and aggregations.
